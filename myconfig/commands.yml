# Handle permissions for every commands here
# You can limit a command to certain roles or certain members with a specific discord permissions.

# +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
# Here is a list of of discord permissions you can use (There are more but these are the important ones)                                     #
# KICK_MEMBERS, BAN_MEMBERS, ADMINISTRATOR, MANAGE_CHANNELS, MANAGE_GUILD, MANAGE_MESSAGES, MANAGE_ROLES, MANAGE_WEBHOOKS and MANAGE_EMOJIS  #
# +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #

# Read about the permissions here -> https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions

# Users specified in the whitelist in config.yml file will bypass every permission check.
# Leaving the permissions blank means anyone can use the command.
# If you limit a command to a specific role, then only those users with that role can access it. And it doesn't matter if they have Admin permission.
# If you limit a command to a specific discord permission, then only those users with that permission can access it. The roles don't matter.

# If you specify a role AND a discord permission, then only the users with the role AND the permission will be able to use it.
# For e.g. if you limit a command to sr mod role and ADMINISTRATOR permission, then only the srmods with the administrator permission will be able to use the command
